# Fire spirit

A simple fire spirit that naturally spawns in the nether. It ignites anyone it attacks, explodes on death dropping a blaze rod, is immune to fire, but takes damage in water. This is a good demonstration of how mobs, skills, and random spawns can all work together to form a fully-functioning mob.
